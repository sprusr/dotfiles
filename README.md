# Scott Street's Dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files that I use for various software, both on my laptop and servers. As it stands, the configs should be copied and renamed appropriately, however I plan to write an installation script to create symlinks to this repo.

These files aren't really tested or intended to be used by others, but if you do end up using them, please let me know and open issues if you think of improvements!
